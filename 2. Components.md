# React Components
The main concept of React is virtual DOM. It is a tree based on JavaScript components created with React that mimics a DOM tree. It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep the React components up to date.
## What?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
## Why?
1. Reusability
2. Separation of concerns<br>
